# KittenTTS Expo Word Timings Example

Expo SDK 55 development-build example created with `create-expo-app`.
This app showcases `KittenTTSResult.wordTimings` by generating audio and
displaying each word's start and end time. It also shows how to start
highlighting only after playback begins.

Expo Go will not work for this app because `@kittentts/react-native` depends on
native modules for ONNX Runtime and filesystem access.

## Run The Example

Run these commands from the repository root. Use a development build; Expo Go
will not work.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js >= 20
- Android Studio with an emulator open for Android
- Xcode with an iOS simulator available for iOS

Android:

```bash
cd examples/ExpoWordTimingsExample
npm install
npm run android
```

iOS:

```bash
cd examples/ExpoWordTimingsExample
npm install
npm run ios
```

After the native app opens, keep Metro running. If you already built the app and
only want to restart JavaScript, use:

```bash
cd examples/ExpoWordTimingsExample
npm start -- --clear
```

## Build A Debug APK

The APK will be written under `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
This is a development-build APK, so start Metro with `npm start` when testing it
after manual install.

```bash
cd examples/ExpoWordTimingsExample
npm install
npx expo prebuild --platform android && cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

On Windows, run the same command in PowerShell but use `.\gradlew.bat
assembleDebug` inside the `android` folder.

## Notes

Tap **Generate** to inspect word-level timestamps without playback, or **Speak**
to generate, play, and show the same timing metadata. The first app run
downloads the Nano int8 model and phonemizer data. Later runs reuse the local
cache.

## What To Copy Into Your App

Use this flow when you want synced word highlighting:

```typescript
const result = await tts.generate(text, { voice });
setResult(result);

await tts.play(result, {
  onPlaybackStart: () => startWordHighlighting(result),
});
```

The example's `startWordHighlighting()` reads `result.wordTimings` and compares
each word's `startTime` / `endTime` against the playback timer.

For long documents, generate smaller chunks instead of one large string:

```typescript
for await (const chunk of tts.stream(longText, { voice })) {
  await tts.play(chunk);
}
```

This is the recommended starting point for EPUB readers, articles, and other
long-form text. Build your own queue if you need pause, resume, chapter state,
or preloading the next paragraph while the current one plays.
